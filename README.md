# MC68000-DIP-PLCC-Adapter
Small adapter designed in "Express PCB".

I made this small PCB to check MC68HC000 CPU in Amiga 500. I couldn't at the time find adapters to purchase on-line, so here it is...

Why "Express PCB"? You may ask. I found it easy for me to add my own components to design and was easy to learn. It has limitations of its own but I found it more challenging when designing something ;)
